Quite proud of this one, CSS isn't perfect (especially in Chrome) and I'll come back to revisit this but it's come a long way from inception. I tried my best to use no global variables as I understand that's bad practice but I did have to use one for penType as I couldn't work out to store the state otherwise.

I learnt a lot about events, handling events and I managed to get click & drag to be recognised rather than just mouse hover which I was proud of. I was hoping to implement the erase function as a right-click and drag but the functionality doesn't seem to exist.

Looking back through my code, maybe I need to use more comments? I'd like to think my code was rather self-explanatory but we'll see when I revist this later down the line!
